						<b> Our purpose:</b>
						<br/>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology, especially computers, may now be considered an integral part of a child's learning in schools. As we have experienced here at ISB, the implementation of various technologies at ISB did help improve our classroom experience and learning efficiency.
					</p>

					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools throughout Thailand have been integrating the use of technologies to further improve children's learning, however, due to the lack of funds, various students in rural schools throughout Thailand have limited accessibility to computers, printers and projectors. Gadgets currently available to the schools are also very dated and inefficient, which could slow down the learning process. As the equipments are not readily available to all students, schools are unable to modernize their lessons, which in turn, may develop students who are less adapted to the technology intensive world. Students would also miss out on an enhanced classroom experience.
					</p>
					<img src="images/service/HS Tech Donator 3.png">
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the ISB HS Tech club would like to invite those inside and outside of the ISB community to donate any sort of unused pieces of technology lying around as they have the possibility of becoming a tool in unlocking unlimited possibilities for the people in need. All donators will recieve a free HS Tech "I Donated" sticker (pictured above) to show our gratitude.

					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old tech donations are collected at the donation stations which will then be safely stored by the end of the school day, ready to undergo refurbishment. All donations will be inspected by the ISB HS Tech team and will receive any sort of technical attention to ensure 100% functionality. Once the specified amount of tech needed is reached, we will deliver the items to the schools in need, ready to be integrated into the children's learning experience.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although our mission statement is "To maximize the learning experience of ISB students through enhancing technology efficiency." We felt that our assistance in the world of technology shouldn't be limited to just ISB students, so we looked for opportunities in assisting the less fortunate in terms of technology use as well. This initiative started our Tech Drive project.
